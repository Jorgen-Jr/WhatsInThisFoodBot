# WhatsInThisFoodBot

I wanted to test out how telegram bots works, so I made this little bot that give you information about the entered food in inline commands.

### Usage

Start typing `@whatsinthisfoodbot` in any chat and it will show what options you have for the desired food. It's a fair simple bot.

### Options
You will have the following options when selecting the food.
    - Food name;
    - Food Category;
    - Brand (If available);
    - Nutrients:
